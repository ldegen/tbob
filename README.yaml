name: tbob - the test-data builder
section: 1
arguments:
  - name: SPEC
    optional: true
    moreThanOnce: true

description: |
  tbob is a tool for creating test data. It reads a world definition from
  world directory. This world definition defines the different types of
  Documents and how to fill them with data.

  tBob then takes on or more document specifications and turns them into actual
  documents. The document specification only includes properties relevant to
  your particular test-case. tBob will flesh out the rest using dummy data.

  A document specification must include a factory name. The factory name may
  be followed by one or more trait names and an optional fill specification.
  Specifications may be read from stdin or given as arguments.

  See the `-f` optoin for supported formats.

  tBob may also be used to output metadata about the specified documents.
  In particular, tBob can create mappings for Elastic Search, if
  the required annotations are present in the world description.

options:
  - short: h
    long: help
    description: Print a help message

  - short: m
    long: manpage
    description: Generate a manual page

  - short: w
    long: world
    argument: PATH
    description: |
      Use an alternative world directory. If ommitted, tBob will search for factory
      definitions in `$TBOB_HOME/tbob/world`.

  - short: f
    long: format
    argument: "ndjson|sexp|yaml"
    description: |
      Specify the format in which document specifications are given.
      The default is `ndjson`. tBob expects specs as json arrays delimited by newline characters.
      It should have the following form:

        ["Factory", "traitA", "traitB", ..., {"key":"value", ...}]

      Note that the other formats are still world in progress; the format has not yet
      stabelized.

  - short: b
    long: bulk
    description: |
      Generate output in ES Bulk Index format.

  - short: B
    long: upload-bulk
    description: |
      Upload generated documents to ElasticSearch.

  - short: m
    long: mapping
    description: |
      Do not output actual documents but ElasticSearch mappings.

  - short: d
    long: only-fill-derived
    description: |
      Do *not* auto-fill missing attributes *unless* they carry
      the annotation `derived: true`

  - short: M
    long: upload-mapping
    description: |
      Upload ElasticSearch mappings.

  - short: C
    long: clear-index
    description: |
      Used in conjunction with `-M`. It will drop and recreate the ElasticSearch index.

  - short: S
    long: index-settings
    argument: PATH
    description: |
      Used in conjunction with `-M`. It will put the index-level settings found in `PATH`
      before uploading the mapping(s). `PATH` should be a file that can be loaded using
      `require`. (i.e. JSON or a CommonJS Module written in some language nodejs understands)

  - short: u
    long: es-url
    argument: URL
    description: |
      Used in conjunction with `-B`, `-M` or `-C` to specify the API endpoint of the
      elasticsearch node to upload to.

  - short: k
    long: default-id-attr
    argument: ATTRIBUTE
    description: |
      Used in conjunction with `-b` or `-B` to specify which attribute should be used for the
      document id when no attribute is specified in the document type's metadata.

      Defaults to `id`.

  - short: y
    long: default-type-attr
    argument: ATTRIBUTE
    description: |
      Used in conjunction with `-b` or `-B` to specify which attribute should be used for the
      document type when neither an attribute nor a type is specified in the
      documnent type's metadata.

      Defaults to `type`.

  - short: x
    long: default-index-attr
    argument: ATTRIBUTE
    description: |
      Used in conjunction with `-b` or `-B` to specify which attribute should be used
      to infer the index the document should be stored to. This option is only used for
      documents where neither an attribute nor a concrete index is specified in the
      documnent type's metadata.

      Defaults to `index`.

  - short: i
    long: default-index
    argument: INDEX_NAME
    description: |
      Used in conjunction with `-b` or `-B` to specify a concrete index to which documents
      for which no index or index attribute was specified in the meta-data should be stored.

      Defaults to `app-test` for historical reasons.

  - short: t
    long: default-type
    argument: TYPE_NAME
    description: |
      Used in conjunction with `-b` or `-B` to specify a mapping type to use for those documents
      for which no type or type attribute was specified in the meta-data.

      Defaults to `project` for historical reasons.

  - short: K
    long: override-id-attr
    argument: ATTRIBUTE
    description: |
      This option works like `-k` expcept that the given attribute name will be used for all
      documents, regardless of their respective type or meta-data.

  - short: Y
    long: override-type-attr
    argument: ATTRIBUTE
    description: |
      This option works like `-y` expcept that the given attribute name will be used for all
      documents, regardless of their respective type or meta-data.

  - short: X
    long: override-index-attr
    argument: ATTRIBUTE
    description: |
      This option works like `-x` expcept that the given attribute name will be used for all
      documents, regardless of their respective type or meta-data.

  - short: I
    long: override-index
    argument: INDEX_NAME
    description: |
      This option works like `-t` except that the given index will be used for all
      documents, regardless of their respective type or meta-data.

  - short: T
    long: override-type
    argument: TYPE_NAME
    description: |
      This option works like `-t` except that the given mapping type will be used for all
      documents, regardless of their respective type or meta-data.
